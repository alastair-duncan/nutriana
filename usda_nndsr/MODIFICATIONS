Modifications made that were missing or incorrect in the data description file ./data/sr25_doc.pdf:

DATA_SRC table
- change record count from 602 to 610
- change Title to allow null because entry S1921 doesn't specify this value
 
DERIV_CD table
- add back SR24 rows NR and O, which are still referenced by NUT_DATA
- (MySQL) SR24 was ok, but SR25 has ^M character after every line
  and there's one empty line between NP and PAE, which causes problems with MySQL.
  Also NP's Deriv_Desc value is not terminated by a ~ (instead there's that emtpy line).
  There are no ways around this other than pre-processing the file.

FOOTNOTE table
- change Footnt_No to allow null because entry 12737 doesn't specify this value
- (MySQL) convert empty string Nutr_No values to null to avoid foreign key error added on FOOTNOTE table
  + this is to fix ERROR 1452 (23000) at line 387: Cannot add or update a child row:
    a foreign key constraint fails (`usda_nndsr`.<result 2 when explaining filename '#sql-36d3_48'>,
    CONSTRAINT `#sql-36d3_48_ibfk_2` FOREIGN KEY (`Nutr_No`) REFERENCES `NUTR_DEF` (`Nutr_No`))
  + the error above occurs with this statement: alter table FOOTNOTE add foreign key (Nutr_No) references NUTR_DEF(Nutr_No)
  + "select distinct Nutr_No from FOOTNOTE order by Nutr_No" reveals there's an empty value, which the NUTR_DEF table does not contain

NUT_DATA table
- change record count from 599359 to 595359
- change DF size from 2 to 4 because entry (04025, 307) and others length is 3, and (14096, 207) and others length is 4
- (MySQL) convert empty string Deriv_Cd values to null to avoid foreign key error added on NUT_DATA table
  + this is to fix ERROR 1452 (23000) at line 368: Cannot add or update a child row:
    a foreign key constraint fails (`usda_nndsr`.<result 2 when explaining filename '#sql-36d3_44'>,
    CONSTRAINT `#sql-36d3_44_ibfk_4` FOREIGN KEY (`Deriv_Cd`) REFERENCES `DERIV_CD` (`Deriv_Cd`))
  + the error above occurs with this statement: alter table NUT_DATA add foreign key (Deriv_Cd) references DERIV_CD(Deriv_Cd)
  + "select distinct DERIV_CD from NUT_DATA order by DERIV_CD" reveals there's an empty value, which the DERIV_CD table does not contain
- (MySQL) convert empty string Ref_NDB_No values to null to avoid foreign key error added on NUT_DATA table
  + this is to fix ERROR 1452 (23000) at line 382: Cannot add or update a child row:
    a foreign key constraint fails (`usda_nndsr`.<result 2 when explaining filename '#sql-36d3_47'>,
    CONSTRAINT `#sql-36d3_47_ibfk_5` FOREIGN KEY (`Ref_NDB_No`) REFERENCES `FOOD_DES` (`NDB_No`))
  + the error above occurs with this statement: alter table NUT_DATA add foreign key (Ref_NDB_No) references FOOD_DES(NDB_No)
  + "select distinct Ref_NDB_No from NUT_DATA order by Ref_NDB_No" reveals there's an empty value, which the FOOD_DES table does not contain

WEIGHT table
- change Msre_Desc size from 80 to 84 because entries (14400, *) have lengths of 83 and 84.
