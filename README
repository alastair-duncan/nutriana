PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This project converts the food composition data released by various official
sources in the world to more modern formats.  Often this data is provided by the
source as an Access database, an Excel file, or a set of character delimited
text files.  For programmatic access, however, some sort of SQL format is
usually prefered to any of the above formats.

HOW IT WORKS:
A human being is needed to create a description file for a given nutrient database.  The JSON format was chosen for readability and portability reasons.  
Nutriana never modifies the nutrient database's data files.  However, to ensure successful database creation and data import, some changes may be necessary to the prescribed database schema or to the casing of the values (i.e. convert values to uppercase).  See the */MODIFICATIONS files for more details.

IF YOUR PREFERRED DATABASE IS NOT SUPPORTED:
It should be easy to add other SQL-based databases by copying one of the Perl module files (*.pm) and edit it to output the format that your database system requires.  (If you find it's not, let me know by creating an issue.)
Run the build.sh file to (re)generate the SQL files.  The script will automatically detect the new .pm file and attempt to output SQL for it.
To alter the database name or user credentials, edit the "generate_sql.pl" file.
