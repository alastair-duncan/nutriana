This project converts the information contained within the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference into SQL files for import into specific database systems.

The database was downloaded from the USDA site at http://www.ars.usda.gov/nutrientdata and was not altered in any way.

Run the build.sh file to generate the SQL files.  Currently, only a MySQL file is created, but it's easy to add files for other database systems.
Simply copy one of the Perl module files (*.pm) and alter it to output the format that the other database system requires. 
To alter the database name or user credentials, edit the "generate_sql.pl" file.

The "db_description.json" file was created manually by extracting the information from the "data/sr24_doc.pdf" file.
Modifications were made to the information in the "data/sr24_doc.pdf" file as well as the resulting SQL to remove any problems importing the nutrient database data; see the "MODIFICATIONS" file.
